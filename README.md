# social-media-api
An API for a basic social media backend that uses NoSQL.

## Description
Social Media API is a Node-based app that uses a Mongoose database to manage large amounts of user data.  Users can create accounts with their email, add friends by ID as well as unfriend users and modify/delete their accounts.  Accounts are used to manage "thoughts" which are public text posts made to the world.  Users can react to posts with "reactions."  These reactions are of a separate schema that is added to the Thought model of data.  This way, all reactions to posts are saved to their respective posts.
